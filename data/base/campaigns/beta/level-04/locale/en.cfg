epilogue=Congratulations, you have finished the basic campaign.\n\nThere is plenty more what you can do in the Factorio. You can go and play the Freeplay. That is one long survival game which combines all of the mechanisms currently present in the game (automating production, research, combat). Or you can try the sandbox scenario and just build whatever you want - there is no goal and no enemies. You can also check out our challenge scenario pack (requires Furnace Attendant membership or higher). There you will be solving logistic puzzles and racing with time to build specialized factories.
